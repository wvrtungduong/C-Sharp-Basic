## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to exercises from my PRN212 course. Each week's excersise are organized in folders with corresponding names.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a different exercise or a set of related exercises. Each directory contains:

- A `README.md` file (optional) with details specific to the exercise.
- The C# source code files (.cs) implementing the solution.
